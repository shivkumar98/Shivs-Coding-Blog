                    Hi! My name is Shiv Kumar; I graduated from Aston University with a BSc in Mathematics.
                    I work as a software developer and do coding both as a hobby and a career.
                    I started my programming journey with MATLAB from my days studying Algorithms and Numrical Analysis.
                    I joined a coding bootcamp shortly after graduating where I was introduced to Java with
                    object-oriented programming.
                    My first job after graduating from University was as a Systems Developer in a leading law firm where
                    I worked with tools provided by Thompson Reuters such as Contract Express.
