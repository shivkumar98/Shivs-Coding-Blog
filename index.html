                    Hi! My name is Shiv Kumar; I graduated from Aston University with a BSc in Mathematics.
                     I work as a software developer and do coding both as a hobby and a career. 
                     I started my programming journey with MATLAB from my days studying Algorithms and Numrical Analysis.
                     I joined a coding bootcamp shortly after graduating where I was introduced to Java programming language with object-oriented programming.
                      My first job after graduating from University was as a Systems Developer in a leading law firm where I worked with tools provided by Thompson Reuters such as Contract Express.
